# Location/Anchor Configuration
# Single source of truth for all filesystem anchors
#
# INVARIANT: WORKSPACE is always the default anchor (not configurable).
# This file defines WHAT anchors exist and how they resolve.
# Scope GRAMMAR (root, inside:X, drive:X, after:X) is defined in Python.

# Named anchors: common filesystem locations
anchors:
  DESKTOP:
    path: "{home}/Desktop"
    aliases:
      - "desktop"
      - "on desktop"
      - "to desktop"
      - "in desktop"
    
  DOCUMENTS:
    path: "{home}/Documents"
    aliases:
      - "documents"
      - "my documents"
      - "in documents"
      - "to documents"
    
  DOWNLOADS:
    path: "{home}/Downloads"
    aliases:
      - "downloads"
      - "in downloads"
      - "to downloads"
    
  HOME:
    path: "{home}"
    aliases:
      - "home"
      - "home folder"
      - "home directory"

# Drive anchors: Windows drive letters
# Auto-generates DRIVE_C, DRIVE_D, etc. with aliases like "c drive", "drive c"
drives:
  enabled_letters: ["C", "D", "E"]
  path_template: "{letter}:/"
  alias_templates:
    - "{letter} drive"
    - "drive {letter}"
    - "{letter}:"
    - "in {letter} drive"
    - "on {letter} drive"

# Reserved keywords that CANNOT be used as aliases
# (These are scope grammar keywords - defined here for validation only)

  - "inside"
  - "after"
  - "drive"
